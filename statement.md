# Student Management System
PROBLEM STATEMENT :

Managing student records manually can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Schools and institutions often struggle to keep track of student details such as roll numbers, names, age, and marks in an organized manner. Searching, updating, or deleting records becomes difficult without a proper system.
To solve this problem, we need a simple, automated, and user-friendly system that allows easy management of student data.
# Scope of the Project :

The Student Management System is designed to help users easily store, manage, and retrieve student records. This project focuses on providing a simple console-based tool that performs basic operations such as adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting records.

It uses CSV file storage, making it lightweight and easy to run on any system without needing a database.

The project demonstrates real-world concepts like CRUD operations, file handling, OOP, and modular programming.
# Target Users :

1. Teachers/Instructors - To record, update, and manage student performance

2. School Administrators - To maintain accurate student records
3. Students/Learners - To understand basic programming logic and file-based record management
   
4. Beginners in Programming - To learn Python concepts like file handling, OOP, classes, and modular coding
 # High-Level Features :
 
1. Add Student

Allows users to input student details such as Roll No, Name, Age, and Marks and store them permanently in a CSV file.

2.View All Students

Displays all student records in a clean, readable format.

3.Search Student

Searches for a student using their roll number and displays the matching record.

4.Update Student

Enables modification of existing student details without affecting other records.

5.Delete Student

Removes a student’s record completely from the system.

6.Persistent Storage

All records are saved in a CSV file, ensuring data remains safe even after closing the program.

7.Modular Design

Code is divided into multiple modules, making it clean, organized, and easy to maintain.
